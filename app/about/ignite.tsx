          To date, Africa remains unstable and troubled with its unparalleled
          potential repressed and therefore wasted under the oppressive yoke of
          statist/socialist systems implemented in the postcolonial era. Through
          Africonomics, the Institute seeks to unlock Africa’s potential by
          providing ethical and sound frameworks to create a new reality of
          economic stability and prosperity.

          The Afrindependent Institute is dedicated to igniting an African
          renaissance by advancing Africonomics and reclaiming the continent’s
          economic heritage of free-market systems. Africa must shift its
          philosophical outlook and embrace Africonomics to break free from the
          ruinous cycle of debt crises, inflation, stagnation, tyranny, poverty,
          and dependence that Western statist models trap African societies in.

          It’s crucial to grasp that free, structurally just, prosperous, and
          dignified postcolonial African societies can be built with
          Africonomics, not Western economics.
