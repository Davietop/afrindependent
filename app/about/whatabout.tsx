            What is Africonomics?

            It’s an African school of philosophical and economic thought.
            Africonomics is a social science grounded in upholding people’s
            natural individual rights [life, liberty, and (self and property)
            ownership]. Its central goal is to study and understand
            socioeconomic phenomena to promote prosperity, justice, and peaceful
            relations within and among human societies.

            Unlike prevailing economics and the other social sciences, which
            rest on philosophical materialism, positivism, and a Darwinian
            conception of humans and human relations, Africonomics is a social
            science premised on the African worldview’s theist, principled, and
            nonrivalrous nature. Notice, however, that Africonomics is not a
            culturalist-historicist approach to economic science. It is a
            natural-moral law approach to economics, jurisprudence, and the
            social sciences with universal applicability.

            Western economics is overwhelmingly based on philosophical
            materialism and a utilitarian-positivist approach, with ethics
            playing practically no role. In contrast, ethics is a cornerstone in
            the African approach to economics and other social sciences, as
            chartered by Africonomics.
